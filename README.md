# QOI utilities

A command-line image encoder written as per specification of the Quite Okay Image format.

Provides quick, uncomplicated lossless image compression by incorporating run-length encoding, 
a running array of seen pixels, the difference to the previous pixel and raw RGB values.

A decoder will be added in the future.
